# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A comprehensive frontend user experience improvement for the existing money transfer application. The current application has a functional backend with Circle integration but suffers from poor user experience on the frontend - the transfer calculator is collapsed when empty, there's no way to proceed with transfers, no recipient selection mechanism, and no complete user flow from calculation to completion. This spec focuses on creating a seamless, intuitive user experience that guides users through the entire transfer process.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the main transfer page THEN the system SHALL display the transfer calculator form with all input fields visible
2. WHEN the send amount field is empty THEN the system SHALL show placeholder content and helpful hints instead of hiding the form
3. WHEN a user enters any amount THEN the system SHALL immediately calculate and display the recipient amount and fees
4. IF the user clears the amount field THEN the system SHALL maintain the form visibility and show helpful guidance

### Requirement 2: Seamless Transfer Flow Navigation

**User Story:** As a user who has calculated a transfer amount, I want to easily proceed to the next step, so that I can complete my money transfer without getting stuck.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has a valid transfer calculation THEN the system SHALL display a prominent "Continue" or "Next" button
2. WHEN a user clicks the continue button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the recipient selection step

### Requirement 3: Recipient Selection and Management

**User Story:** As a user sending money, I want to easily select or add recipients, so that I can specify who should receive the money.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user proceeds from the calculator THEN the system SHALL display a recipient selection interface
2. WHEN a user has no saved recipients THEN the system SHALL provide a form to add new recipient details
3. WHEN a user has saved recipients THEN the system SHALL display them as selectable options with an option to add new ones

### Requirement 4: Integrated Payment Flow

**User Story:** As a user who has selected a recipient, I want to complete the payment seamlessly, so that I can finalize the money transfer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes recipient selection THEN the system SHALL display the payment form with transfer summary
2. WHEN a user submits payment details THEN the system SHALL process the payment using the existing Circle integration
3. WHEN payment is successful THEN the system SHALL immediately redirect to the transfer status page
4. IF payment fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and allow retry

### Requirement 5: Real-time Transfer Status Tracking

**User Story:** As a user who has initiated a transfer, I want to see real-time status updates, so that I know when my recipient has received the money.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. IF the user switches between devices THEN the system SHALL maintain transfer state where possible

### Requirement 7: User Authentication Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the transfer process to work seamlessly with the existing authentication system, so that I can access my account and transfer history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to proceed past calculation THEN the system SHALL prompt for sign-in

2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages with retry options
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and allow recovery
4. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide support contact information and preserve user data
