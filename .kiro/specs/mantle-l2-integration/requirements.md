# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates Mantle L2 blockchain into our existing Circle-powered international transfer platform to provide faster, cheaper cross-border transactions while maintaining the reliability of our current infrastructure. The integration will position our platform as a next-generation fintech solution that combines traditional payment rails (Circle) with cutting-edge L2 technology (Mantle) for optimal user experience and cost efficiency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user sending international transfers, I want to choose between traditional and blockchain-powered transfer methods, so that I can optimize for speed and cost based on my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a transfer THEN the system SHALL present both Circle (traditional) and Mantle L2 (blockchain) transfer options
2. WHEN a user selects Mantle L2 option THEN the system SHALL display estimated gas costs and transfer time (typically under 2 minutes)
3. WHEN a user selects Circle option THEN the system SHALL display traditional transfer fees and processing time
4. IF the transfer amount is below $100 THEN the system SHALL recommend Mantle L2 for cost efficiency
5. IF the transfer amount is above $1000 THEN the system SHALL recommend Circle for regulatory compliance and reliability

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless wallet integration with Mantle L2, so that I can send and receive transfers without complex blockchain interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first uses Mantle transfers THEN the system SHALL automatically create a Mantle-compatible wallet using their existing account
2. WHEN a user initiates a Mantle transfer THEN the system SHALL handle all blockchain interactions transparently
3. WHEN a user receives a Mantle transfer THEN the system SHALL automatically convert to their preferred fiat currency if requested
4. IF a user wants to keep crypto THEN the system SHALL provide a simple interface to view and manage their Mantle wallet balance
5. WHEN a user switches between transfer methods THEN the system SHALL maintain a unified transaction history

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to showcase our Mantle integration on the landing page, so that I can attract tech-savvy users and demonstrate innovation for the cookathon.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visitors view the landing page THEN the system SHALL prominently display "Powered by Mantle L2" with speed and cost benefits
2. WHEN visitors interact with the transfer calculator THEN the system SHALL show real-time comparison between Circle and Mantle options
3. WHEN visitors view our technology stack THEN the system SHALL highlight the hybrid Circle + Mantle architecture
4. IF a visitor is interested in blockchain features THEN the system SHALL provide educational content about L2 benefits
5. WHEN showcasing for the cookathon THEN the system SHALL include metrics like "90% cheaper gas fees" and "2-minute settlements"

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain our existing Circle infrastructure while adding Mantle capabilities, so that we can offer both traditional and blockchain options without disrupting current users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating Mantle THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing Circle API integrations
2. WHEN a user chooses transfer method THEN the system SHALL route to appropriate service (Circle or Mantle) based on selection
3. WHEN handling Mantle transactions THEN the system SHALL use the same database schema with additional blockchain-specific fields
4. IF Mantle network is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to Circle processing
5. WHEN processing either transfer type THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent user experience and notification patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want proper tracking and reporting for Mantle transactions, so that we maintain regulatory compliance while offering blockchain options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Mantle transaction occurs THEN the system SHALL log all transaction details including wallet addresses and transaction hashes
2. WHEN generating compliance reports THEN the system SHALL include both Circle and Mantle transaction data
3. WHEN a transaction exceeds regulatory thresholds THEN the system SHALL apply the same KYC/AML checks regardless of transfer method
4. IF regulatory requirements change THEN the system SHALL be able to disable Mantle options while maintaining Circle functionality
5. WHEN auditing transactions THEN the system SHALL provide clear audit trails for both traditional and blockchain transfers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user in regions with high remittance costs, I want access to Mantle's low-cost transfers, so that I can send more money to my family by paying lower fees.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is in a high-cost remittance corridor THEN the system SHALL prominently recommend Mantle L2 option
2. WHEN calculating transfer costs THEN the system SHALL show potential savings with Mantle vs traditional methods
3. WHEN a user completes a Mantle transfer THEN the system SHALL display actual savings achieved
4. IF network congestion affects costs THEN the system SHALL provide real-time fee estimates and alternative timing suggestions
5. WHEN targeting remittance markets THEN the system SHALL provide localized education about blockchain benefits
