# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a peer-to-peer payment application that facilitates international money transfers between users. The system is designed to optimize cost-effectiveness and user experience based on geographic location, supporting both registered and unregistered users through intelligent payment processor selection and backend settlement routing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Payment Processor Selection

4. WHEN routing decisions are made THEN the system SHALL consider both cost and reliability factors
5. IF the primary settlement service fails THEN the system SHALL automatically failover to the next best option

### Requirement 5: Payment Processing and Confirmation

4. WHEN payment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options
5. WHEN payment is complete THEN the system SHALL update the transaction status for tracking purposes

### Requirement 6: Fund Settlement and Delivery

**User Story:** As a receiver (User A), I want to receive funds directly in my linked bank account, so that I can access the money without additional transfer steps.
