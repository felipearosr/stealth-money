# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A mobile/web application that enables users to send money internationally with zero friction. Users in one country (e.g., USA) can send money in their local currency (USD) to recipients in another country (e.g., Germany) who receive the equivalent amount in their local currency (EUR). The entire process is powered by stablecoins for fast, cheap cross-border transfers, but users never see or interact with cryptocurrency directly.

## Requirements

2. WHEN a user provides recipient information and payment details THEN the system SHALL process the transfer within 5 minutes

### Requirement 3: Real-time Exchange Rate Calculation

**User Story:** As a sender, I want to see exactly how much the recipient will receive before I confirm the transfer, so that there are no surprises about the exchange rate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sender initiates a transfer THEN the system SHALL collect the recipient's bank account details
2. WHEN the transfer is processed THEN the system SHALL convert USDC to EUR and deposit to the recipient's account

4. IF the bank deposit fails THEN the system SHALL retry automatically and notify both parties

### Requirement 5: Transfer Status Tracking

**User Story:** As a sender, I want to track the status of my transfer in real-time, so that I know when the recipient has received the money.

#### Acceptance Criteria
