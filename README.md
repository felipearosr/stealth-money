# Stealth Money - Seamless Global Money Transfers

**Mantle Hackathon Submission**

A revolutionary money transfer platform that makes blockchain-powered international transfers as simple as sending a text message. Built for the Mantle Network hackathon, Stealth Money eliminates the complexity of blockchain interactions while leveraging its security and efficiency.

## The Problem We Solve

Traditional international money transfers are expensive, slow, and complex. Existing blockchain solutions require users to:
- Create and manage crypto wallets
- Understand gas fees and transaction mechanics  
- Navigate complex DeFi protocols
- Handle private keys and seed phrases

**Stealth Money changes this.** Non-technical users can send money globally without ever knowing they're using blockchain technology.

## Key Features

**For End Users:**
- Send money internationally with just an email and phone number
- No wallet creation or blockchain knowledge required
- Real-time exchange rates and transparent fees
- Instant payment confirmation via familiar payment methods
- Track transfers with simple status updates

**Technical Innovation:**
- Mantle Network integration for fast, low-cost settlements
- Smart contract escrow system for secure fund management
- Hybrid payment processing (traditional + blockchain)
- Automated currency conversion and routing
- Circle API integration for seamless fiat-to-crypto conversion

## How It Works

1. **User Experience**: Users enter recipient details and transfer amount through a familiar web interface
2. **Payment Processing**: Traditional payment methods (cards, bank transfers) collect funds
3. **Smart Contract Escrow**: Funds are held securely in Mantle Network smart contracts
4. **Automated Settlement**: Upon payment confirmation, smart contracts automatically release funds
5. **Recipient Notification**: Recipients receive funds in their preferred method without blockchain complexity

## Mantle Network Integration

**Why Mantle?**
- **Low Transaction Costs**: Significantly reduced gas fees compared to Ethereum mainnet
- **Fast Finality**: Quick transaction confirmation for better user experience
- **EVM Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing Ethereum tooling
- **Scalability**: Handle high transaction volumes efficiently

**Technical Implementation:**
- Smart contracts deployed on Mantle Network for escrow management
- Optimized gas usage through efficient contract design
- Integration with Mantle's infrastructure for reliable transaction processing
- Support for MNT token and other Mantle ecosystem assets

## Architecture

This is a monorepo with three main packages:

- **`packages/web`** - Next.js frontend with intuitive user interface
- **`packages/api`** - Express.js backend with Mantle Network integration
- **`packages/contracts`** - Solidity smart contracts optimized for Mantle

## Quick Start Guide

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_clerk_key
```

### 3. Database Setup

```bash
cd packages/api
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

### 4. Smart Contract Deployment

```bash
cd packages/contracts
npm install
npm run compile

# Deploy to Mantle testnet
npm run deploy:testnet
```

### 5. Start Development

```bash
# Terminal 1: API Server
cd packages/api && npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd packages/web && npm run dev

# Terminal 3: Contract development (optional)
cd packages/contracts && npx hardhat node
```

### 6. Access Application

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **API**: http://localhost:4000
- **API Health**: http://localhost:4000/health
