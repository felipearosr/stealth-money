# Stealth Money - Peer-to-Peer Global Payment Platform

**Mantle Hackathon Submission**

A revolutionary peer-to-peer payment platform that makes blockchain-powered international transfers as simple as sending a text message. Built for the Mantle Network hackathon, Stealth Money eliminates the complexity of blockchain interactions while leveraging intelligent payment processor selection and cost-optimized settlement routing.

## The Problem We Solve

Traditional international money transfers are expensive, slow, and complex. Existing blockchain solutions require users to:
- Create and manage crypto wallets
- Understand gas fees and transaction mechanics  
- Navigate complex DeFi protocols
- Handle private keys and seed phrases

**Stealth Money changes this.** Non-technical users can send money globally without ever knowing they're using blockchain technology.

## Key Features

**Peer-to-Peer Payment System:**
- Request money from anyone via QR codes or shareable links
- Support for both registered and unregistered users
- Intelligent payment processor selection based on geographic location
- Smart settlement routing for cost optimization
- Real-time payment status tracking and notifications

**For End Users:**
- Send money internationally with just an email and phone number
- No wallet creation or blockchain knowledge required
- Real-time exchange rates and transparent fees
- Instant payment confirmation via familiar payment methods
- Track transfers with simple status updates

**Technical Innovation:**
- Mantle Network integration for fast, low-cost settlements
- Smart contract escrow system for secure fund management
- Hybrid payment processing (traditional + blockchain)
- Automated currency conversion and routing
- Circle API integration for seamless fiat-to-crypto conversion
- Geographic-based payment processor optimization (Plaid, Stripe, etc.)

## How It Works

### Traditional Transfer Flow
1. **User Experience**: Users enter recipient details and transfer amount through a familiar web interface
2. **Payment Processing**: Traditional payment methods (cards, bank transfers) collect funds
3. **Smart Contract Escrow**: Funds are held securely in Mantle Network smart contracts
4. **Automated Settlement**: Upon payment confirmation, smart contracts automatically release funds
5. **Recipient Notification**: Recipients receive funds in their preferred method without blockchain complexity

### Peer-to-Peer Payment Request Flow
1. **Payment Request Creation**: Registered users generate payment requests with QR codes or shareable links
2. **Unregistered User Access**: Recipients access requests via QR/link and are guided through app onboarding
3. **Intelligent Processor Selection**: System analyzes sender's location and selects optimal payment processor (Plaid, Stripe, etc.)
4. **Smart Settlement Routing**: Funds are routed through the most cost-effective settlement service (Mantle vs Circle)
5. **Real-time Notifications**: Both parties receive status updates throughout the payment lifecycle

## Mantle Network Integration

**Why Mantle?**
- **Low Transaction Costs**: Significantly reduced gas fees compared to Ethereum mainnet
- **Fast Finality**: Quick transaction confirmation for better user experience
- **EVM Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing Ethereum tooling
- **Scalability**: Handle high transaction volumes efficiently

**Technical Implementation:**
- Smart contracts deployed on Mantle Network for escrow management
- Optimized gas usage through efficient contract design
- Integration with Mantle's infrastructure for reliable transaction processing
- Support for MNT token and other Mantle ecosystem assets

## Architecture

This is a monorepo with three main packages:

- **`packages/web`** - Next.js frontend with intuitive user interface

### Technical Innovation
1. **Hybrid Architecture**: Traditional payments trigger blockchain settlements
2. **Smart Contract Escrow**: Automated fund release without user intervention
3. **Gas Optimization**: Mantle-specific contract optimizations for minimal costs
4. **Seamless Integration**: Circle API bridges fiat and crypto seamlessly

### Market Impact
- **Accessibility**: Opens blockchain benefits to 2+ billion unbanked users
- **Cost Reduction**: 80%+ reduction in transfer fees
- **Speed Improvement**: 100x faster than traditional wire transfers
- **Global Reach**: Support for 150+ currencies and countries
