# Chilean Onboarding Requirements Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Task 7: "Enforce Chilean onboarding requirements" from the Chilean User Transfer MVP specification.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Enhanced OnboardingGate Component

**File:** `packages/web/src/components/features/OnboardingGate.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `requireChileanVerification` prop to enforce Chilean-specific requirements
- Enhanced bank account validation to check for verified Chilean accounts (CLP currency, CL country)
- Updated onboarding logic to specifically require Chilean bank verification when `requireChileanVerification` is true
- Prevented skipping when Chilean verification is required

**Key Features:**
- Checks for verified Chilean bank accounts (currency: CLP, country: CL)
- Enforces Chilean verification requirements independently of general verification
- Handles mixed account scenarios correctly (e.g., verified US + unverified Chilean)

### 2. Enhanced BankAccountOnboardingV2 Component

**File:** `packages/web/src/components/features/BankAccountOnboardingV2.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `requireChileanVerification` prop support
- Auto-defaults to Chile (CL) when Chilean verification is required
- Restricts country selection to Chile only when `requireChileanVerification` is true
- Updated UI messaging to show Chilean-specific onboarding requirements
- Enhanced verification completion logic to check Chilean requirements
- Updated status summaries to show Chilean verification status

**Key Features:**
- Chilean-specific messaging and guidance
- Automatic Chile selection for Chilean flows
- Restricted country options when Chilean verification is required
- Chilean verification status tracking

### 3. Chilean-Specific Onboarding Gate

**File:** `packages/web/src/components/features/ChileanOnboardingGate.tsx`

**Purpose:** 
A specialized component that enforces Chilean onboarding requirements for Chilean transfer flows.

**Features:**
- Always requires Chilean bank verification
- Blocks transfers until Chilean verification is complete
- Cannot be skipped
- Designed specifically for Chilean user-to-user transfers

### 4. Test Implementation

**Files:**
- `packages/web/src/components/features/__tests__/ChileanOnboardingGate.test.tsx`
- `packages/web/src/components/features/__tests__/ChileanOnboardingGateComponent.test.tsx`
- `packages/web/test-chilean-simple.js`

**Test Coverage:**
- Chilean verification requirement enforcement
- Mixed account scenarios (verified US + unverified Chilean, etc.)
- Proper blocking of access without verified Chilean accounts
- Component behavior with different account combinations

### 5. Demo Page

**File:** `packages/web/src/app/test-chilean-onboarding/page.tsx`

**Purpose:** 
Demonstrates the Chilean onboarding requirements in action.

**Features:**
- Shows how the Chilean onboarding gate works
- Explains the requirements to users
- Provides visual feedback on onboarding completion

## Requirements Compliance

### Requirement 1.1: Mandatory Account Creation
✅ **Implemented:** Users are required to complete account creation before accessing transfer features through the Chilean onboarding gate.

### Requirement 1.2: Automatic Bank Account Setup Redirect
✅ **Implemented:** Users are automatically redirected to bank account setup when they don't have verified Chilean accounts.

### Requirement 1.3: Transfer Feature Access Control
✅ **Implemented:** Users without verified bank accounts are redirected to the onboarding flow and cannot access transfer features.

### Requirement 1.5: Prevent Skipping Onboarding
✅ **Implemented:** Users cannot skip the Chilean onboarding process when `requireChileanVerification` is true.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Chilean Verification Logic

```typescript
// Check for verified Chilean accounts
const hasVerifiedChileanAccount = accountsArray.some((account: BankAccount) => 
  account.isVerified && account.country === 'CL' && account.currency === 'CLP'
);

// Enforce Chilean requirements
if (requireChileanVerification) {
  const needsOnboarding = !hasVerifiedChileanAccount;
  setNeedsOnboarding(needsOnboarding);
}
```

### Component Integration

```typescript
// Chilean-specific onboarding gate usage
<ChileanOnboardingGate onOnboardingComplete={handleComplete}>
  <ChileanTransferFlow />
</ChileanOnboardingGate>

// Or with the enhanced OnboardingGate
<OnboardingGate requireChileanVerification={true}>
  <ProtectedContent />
</OnboardingGate>
```

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ 5 tests for OnboardingGate Chilean requirements
- ✅ 4 tests for ChileanOnboardingGate component
- ✅ Integration tests for Chilean verification logic

## Usage Examples

### For Chilean Transfer Flows
```typescript
import ChileanOnboardingGate from '@/components/features/ChileanOnboardingGate';

export default function ChileanTransferPage() {
  return (
    <ChileanOnboardingGate>
      <ChileanTransferFlow />
    </ChileanOnboardingGate>
  );
}
```

### For General Flows with Chilean Requirements
```typescript
import OnboardingGate from '@/components/features/OnboardingGate';

export default function SomePage() {
  return (
    <OnboardingGate requireChileanVerification={true}>
      <ProtectedContent />
    </OnboardingGate>
  );
}
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Strict Enforcement:** Chilean verification requirements cannot be bypassed
2. **User-Friendly:** Clear messaging and automatic Chile selection
3. **Flexible:** Can be used in different contexts (dedicated component or prop-based)
4. **Robust:** Handles complex account scenarios correctly
5. **Tested:** Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability

## Next Steps

This implementation provides the foundation for Chilean onboarding requirements. The components can now be integrated into the Chilean transfer flow to ensure users have verified Chilean bank accounts before they can send or receive money.
