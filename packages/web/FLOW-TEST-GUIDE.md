## 🚨 Common Issues to Check:

### ❌ If OnboardingGate doesn't refresh:
- Check console for "Account added, refreshing status..."
- Verify API returns accounts correctly
- Check network tab for 401 errors

### ❌ If verification doesn't work:
- Ensure BankAccountVerification component loads
- Check for missing verification API endpoints
- Verify onComplete callback is called

### ❌ If stuck in onboarding loop:
- Check `hasVerifiedAccount` logic in console
- Verify account `isVerified` field is updated
- Check OnboardingGate refresh logic
